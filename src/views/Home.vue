    <h1>Hello there...</h1>

    <p>
      This is a simple/quick prototype of the task that was given, keeping in
      mind that I started working on this task today (28/10) . This task uses a
      combination of vue, bootstrap ,vueify and axios. The UI is fairly
      primitive (can be a lot better given enough time obviously), The core
      functions however should work as expected. I am well aware of the fact
      that some pages should be "hidden" until the user is logged in, But for
      the sake of faster evaluation everything is in the navbar. Also feedback
      would be greatly appreciated :)
